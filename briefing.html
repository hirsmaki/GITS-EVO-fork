Ranks
<br>
<br>
You are awarded ranks based on your score.  The rank multiplier is set at startup and may range from 10 to 200 points.
<br>
So for example, if rank multiplier is 20, then Colonel will be awarded at 6 x 20 = 120 points.  
<br>
If the multiplier is set at 100, then corporal will be awarded at 1x 100 = 100 points and 
<br>
colonel will be awarded at 6 x 100 = 600 points.

<h4>
<br>
Welcome to Evolution soldier! Now pay attention and listen up, because we are facing a toughened enemy this time.  This briefing will keep you focussed on your objectives, and will no doubt save your life...
<br>
<br>
To complete the campaign, you need to re-take every town on the map.
<br>
<br>
Each town is protected by Air Defences.  Locate and destroy 3 Anti-Air units to protect your own airborne units.  Once all three units are destroyed the red hatching will disappear from the map.
<br>
<br>
Each town contains a Radio Tower. Destroy it to prevent reinforcements being sent to the town under siege. Radio Towers can only be destroyed with a satchel bomb. You will receive 10 points for successfully cutting communications.
<br>
<br>
Once the Radio Tower is down, proceed to sweep the area and kill all armed enemy units until the bastards surrender.  When a town falls, remaining troops drop their guns and can be captured and returned to the POW camp near our Base for 5 points per head. To capture enemies you must first identify them (default right click) then choose the action Capture.  Enemy troops mounted on MG's, Grenade Launchers or Artillery Cannons will not surrender - shoot them on sight!
<br>
<br>
Each town has a Commanding Officer dressed in olive drab.  He is a PRIORITY TARGET. Capture him and return him to the POW Camp near our Base for 20 points. Never shoot the officer, he is always unarmed.  Beware of bombing/ grenading the area where he is located.  Do not shoot other unarmed soldiers as they may be someones prisoner.  
<br>
<br>
If you kill an unarmed enemy you will be fined 30 points and may be demoted and you will find my boot in your ass.
<br>
<br>
Now, you can change some settings in the Spawn Hangar - go to the back of the hangar and check your Action menu.  
<br>
<br>
You can set your terrain detail (grass), View distance and Air view distance (How far you see in a plane or chopper) in the Spawn Hangar. High settings may make your system unstable.
<br>
<br>
If you Request Transfer at the Spawn Hangar you can join another players squad.  You can also do this when in a vehicle, using the Radio - My Squad - function.
<br>
<br>
Some notes on classes. 
<br>
<br>
If you're a Medic you can set up a MASH (Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) when players heal (enemy inflicted wounds) you get points. As Medic your priority must be healing.
<br>
<br>
If you're an Engineer you can set up a FARP (Forward Arming and Refueling Point) when you are near a repair vehicle. If you fully repair a marked vehicle at your farp you will earn points. As Engineer your priority must be repair.
<br>
<br>
If you're in command of a vehicle, stop at the Airbase, FARP or Dock to be fully serviced.
<br>
<br>
Some snipers are equipped with ghillie suits which offer them extra concealment from the enemy.
<br>
<br>
Ready to go then?  Here are some tips on getting into battle.
<br>
<br>
Moving the Ambulance near to your objective is a wise move.  Your comrades can then re-spawn there and join the battle quickly.  You can also Heal at the ambulance.  Beware! Do not endanger the Ambulance, as you cannot spawn there if it is damaged.
<br>
<br>
As you earn points, you will be promoted and new support options will become available.  Drivers of vehicles earn points for carrying soldiers into battle from the Base.  The Little Bird MH-6 respawns after 5 mins, so you can use it to shuttle your squad quickly into battle.
<br>
<br>
You can Request a HALO (High Altitude, Low Opening) parachute insertion from Mission HQ. You start at 15,000m over the Halo Insertion Point near Corazol.  Use your mouse to steer.  Press ESC to open your chute at >100m.  Open it higher and you will have a long time to admire the scenery.
<br>
<br>
Pilots of the larger helicopters can winch vehicles into and out of battle.  Learn to winch! You can rapidly deploy your forces this way.
<br>
<br>
As Squad Leader you have many <a href="#RAD">Radio commands</a>.
<br>
<br>
If you select Recruit Player on your radio or in the Spawn Hangar you can recruit AI units into your squad.  Beware! They will fire on POW's in vehicles, including your own!  Drop them from your squad before mounting a prisoner into a vehicle
<br>
<br>
If you select Mission on your radio or in the Spawn Hangar you can take a Side Mission for points.  You can choose from Water Patrol, Land Patrol, Combat Air Patrol, Search and Rescue, Ambush Convoy, Destroy Armour, Defence, Rendition and Extermination missions.  Each squad member will score between 10 - 40 points for completing each Mission.
<br>
<br>
Squad Leaders - you can set a squad waypoint by holding shift and left clicking the map. Remove squad waypoint by holding alt and left clicking the map.  Any player can double click on the map to mark locations.  Press DOWN ARROW to change icons.
<br>
<br>
You can request Support on your radio but it costs points.  Choose between Supply Drops (Ammo Crate, Fuel, Motorbike, Inflatable Boat, MG Station, Fortress, Mortar, Armoured Boat, Artilley Cannon, AA Gun), Artillery (Precision strike, Small Artillery, Cluster Bomb, Large Artillery, LArge Area Fire, Chemical Strike and Nuclear ICBM), Smoke (Smoke Marker, Smokescreen), Illumination and HALO extraction.  Options increase with rank.
Vehicle notes: Only GBU armed aircraft can lock-on to infantry laser designators.  Some vehicles use a weapon camera. To go back to normal view press any key.  A Special vehicle will become available at Colonel Rank.
<br>
<br>
If you disconnect and reconnect your score and rank will be retained.
<br>
<br>
That is all, grab your kit and get moving.
